# What is a bank churn and why does it occur ? 

With the advent of digital banking, it has become extremely convenient for users to open a new bank account. As opposed to the age old tradition of submitting multiple documents and credit histories after visiting a bank, the process has been revamped by a great deal with an user needing less than 10 minutes to open an account in the comfort of their couches.

However, with digital banking, it has also become convenient for users to close a bank account, more commonly termed as a **"churn"**. While this may appear to be a win for consumers, it is however important to understand the reasons and the effects that entail from a bank churn.

# Reasons for a churn to occur
A bank account churn could occur for a multitiude of reasons which are important for banks to analyse to reduce attrition of customers and also remain competitive in the market. Some of the reasons are:

-   **Fees and Charges:** High fees or unexpected charges can prompt customers to switch banks. This may include monthly maintenance fees, ATM fees, overdraft fees, and other charges.
-   **Low Interest Rates:** If a bank offers low interest rates on savings accounts or certificates of deposit, customers might look for better opportunities elsewhere to maximize their returns.
-   **Poor Customer Service:** Inadequate customer service, long wait times, and unhelpful staff can lead to frustration and dissatisfaction, prompting customers to seek better service elsewhere.
-   **Branch Accessibility:** Limited access to physical branches or ATMs can be a significant factor. If a customer moves to an area where their current bank has limited presence, they might switch to a more accessible option.
-   **Technology and Online Services:** Customers may switch to a bank that provides better online and mobile banking services, as technology plays an increasingly crucial role in the banking experience.
-   **Incentives and Promotions:** Banks often attract new customers by offering promotions, bonuses, or better interest rates. Existing customers may churn to take advantage of these offers.
-   **Changes in Financial Needs:** As individuals' financial situations evolve, their banking needs may change. For example, a customer might require more advanced financial products, and if their current bank can't meet those needs, they may switch to a different institution.
-   **Mergers and Acquisitions:** Changes resulting from bank mergers or acquisitions, such as alterations in account terms, fees, or service quality, can drive customers to seek alternatives.
-   **Ethical or Social Reasons:** Some customers may choose to switch banks due to concerns about a bank's ethical practices, social responsibility, or involvement in controversial activities.
-   **Security Concerns:** If a bank experiences a security breach or if customers perceive their accounts to be at risk, they may opt to move their funds to a more secure institution.
-   **Better Financial Products:** Customers may switch banks to access better financial products, such as higher-interest savings accounts, more competitive loan rates, or improved credit card offerings.
-   **Life Events:** Major life events like marriage, divorce, retirement, or the death of a spouse can prompt individuals to reassess their banking relationships and switch to better-suited options.
